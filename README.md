# Ayrshare for Claude Code

The unified social media API for AI agents. Publish, schedule, and analyze across 13+ networks directly from Claude Code, with post history for brand voice and validation against each platform's rules before every post. Powered by the [Ayrshare](https://www.ayrshare.com) API.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare
```

Then run `/ayrshare:setup` to add your API key and **restart Claude Code**. Scopes and other install paths are under [Installation](#installation) below.

## Overview

The plugin lets an agent run the full social workflow without leaving Claude Code. Before publishing, the agent validates each post against the target network's rules and asks you to confirm, so avoidable rejections are caught before anything goes live. A single request publishes to Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, Reddit, Telegram, Threads, Bluesky, and others. Post history is available for matching a brand's voice, and analytics can be read back to inform the next post. Platform integrations are maintained by Ayrshare, so upstream API changes are handled outside your code. The API currently handles 25M+ calls per day.

## The loop

- **Learn**. Retrieve a profile's post history for brand-voice context and review how past posts performed.
- **Act**. Publish and schedule across 13+ networks in a single call.
- **Observe**. Read live analytics to inform the next post.
- **Stay safe**. Validate each post against platform rules, then confirm before publishing.

---
## Why use the API instead of a custom integration?

An LLM can generate an OAuth flow, but it does not cover Meta Tech Provider approval, X's pay-per-use API changes, or ongoing maintenance when a network changes its rules. The plugin handles:

- **Pre-publish validation**. `validate_post` dry-runs content against each network's rules (length, format, media requirements) before you publish, and `validate_media` checks that a media URL is reachable before you attach it in `mediaUrls`. X BYOK is supported for the 2026 mandate, and platform integrations are maintained so an upstream API change does not break your integration.
- **One call, 13+ networks**. A single request publishes to all connected platforms, each validated against its own rules.
- **Multi-tenant**. Post on behalf of many user profiles rather than a single brand.
- **History API**. Retrieve a profile's past posts for brand-voice context, and use historical performance data to inform future posts.

### Safety

By default the plugin validates a post and requests confirmation before publishing. The agent prepares the draft; the user approves it.

## Installation

### Plugin installation scopes

The plugin scope controls where commands, agents, and skills are available. First register this repo as a marketplace (one time):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin
```

Then install the `ayrshare` plugin (`plugin@marketplace`) at the scope you want:

| Scope | Command | Where it's available |
|---|---|---|
| Global (default) | `claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare` | Every project on this machine |
| This project only | `claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare --scope local` | Current project, not committed to git |
| This project (shared) | `claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare --scope project` | Current project, committed to git with the team |

After installing, configure your API key:

```text
/ayrshare:setup
```

`/ayrshare:setup` will ask for your key and where to store it — choose the option that matches how you installed the plugin.

---

### Detailed walkthroughs

#### Global — available in all your projects

```bash
# 1. Register the marketplace (one time)
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin

# 2. Install the plugin globally (user is the default scope)
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare

# 3. Configure your API key (sets AYRSHARE_API_KEY in ~/.claude/settings.json)
# Run inside Claude Code:
/ayrshare:setup   # accept the default "Global" when asked
```

Commands, agents, and skills are available in every project. The key is stored as `AYRSHARE_API_KEY` in `~/.claude/settings.json`, which is exactly what the plugin's MCP server reads. No project files are modified.

---

#### This project only — local, not committed

```bash
# 1. Register the marketplace (one time)
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin

# 2. Install scoped to the current project (not committed to git)
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare --scope local

# 3. Configure your API key (sets AYRSHARE_API_KEY in ./.claude/settings.local.json)
# Run inside Claude Code:
/ayrshare:setup   # choose "This project" when asked
```

Commands, agents, and skills only appear in this project. The key is written as `AYRSHARE_API_KEY` to `./.claude/settings.local.json` so it stays out of git. Ensure that path is in your `.gitignore` (a default `*.local` pattern does **not** match `settings.local.json`) and confirm `git status` does not list it. Use the committed `./.claude/settings.json` only if you deliberately want to share one key with your team via the repo (not recommended for a secret).

---

#### This project — committed with the team

```bash
# 1. Register the marketplace (one time)
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin

# 2. Install scoped to the project (committed to git)
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare --scope project

# 3. Configure your API key (sets your key in ./.claude/settings.local.json, gitignored)
# Run inside Claude Code:
/ayrshare:setup   # choose "This project" when asked
```

The plugin is committed to the repo so the whole team gets it automatically. Each developer runs `/ayrshare:setup` individually to configure their own API key. Each developer's key should go in `./.claude/settings.local.json`, and that path should be added to `.gitignore` (a default `*.local` pattern does **not** match `settings.local.json`) so keys are never committed.

---

### MCP only (no plugin)

If you only want the raw MCP tools without commands, agents, or skills:

```bash
claude mcp add ayrshare --transport http \
  https://api.ayrshare.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Add `--scope local` to limit it to the current project. The key is stored permanently in Claude Code's config — run once and you are done.

---

### Environment variable (CI / advanced)

For CI environments or users who manage env vars via shell profile:

```bash
export AYRSHARE_API_KEY=your_key_here
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare
```

The plugin's `.mcp.json` uses `${AYRSHARE_API_KEY}` — Claude Code substitutes it at startup. No setup command needed.

---

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/ayrshare:setup` | Configure or rotate your API key |

The former `/ayrshare:post`, `/ayrshare:analytics`, and `/ayrshare:profiles` commands were consolidated into the **social-manager** and **profile-manager** agents and the trigger-based skills below.

---

## Skills

Trigger-based skills activate automatically on intent (even when you don't name Ayrshare) and teach Claude how to drive the MCP tools correctly: the auth model (API key, plus optional profile selection by `Profile-Key` header or per-call `profileKey` argument), retry safety, and platform quirks. They cover all 27 of the server's tools. **Start with `getting-started`**; every group skill cross-links to it.

| Skill | Tools | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `getting-started` | (cross-cutting) | Installing/configuring the plugin, any 401/403, "which credential do I use", onboarding a client, or missing `AYRSHARE_API_KEY`. Home of the auth model (API key, plus `Profile-Key` header or per-call `profileKey` argument), onboarding sequence, retry/`explain_error` rules, and the free-trial link. |
| `post` | `create_post`, `validate_post`, `get_post`, `update_post`, `retry_post` | Validating, posting, scheduling, editing, fetching, or retrying social content. |
| `history` | `get_post_history`, `get_platform_history` | Listing posts sent via Ayrshare, or native posts (incl. ones not made via Ayrshare) and finding native Social Post IDs. |
| `analytics` | `get_post_analytics`, `get_post_analytics_by_social_id`, `get_social_network_analytics` | Per-post analytics (by Ayrshare or native Social Post ID) or account/network analytics (followers, reach, impressions). |
| `comments` | `get_comments`, `add_comment`, `reply_comment` | Reading, adding, or replying to comments on a post. |
| `messages` | `get_messages`, `send_message`, `get_auto_response`, `set_auto_response` | Reading/sending direct messages (Facebook, Instagram, X) or configuring the DM auto-responder. |
| `profiles` | `list_profiles`, `create_profile`, `generate_jwt_social_linking_url` | Creating or listing client profiles (account-level), or minting a client's social-account linking URL for the target profile (set by the `profileKey` argument or `Profile-Key` header; Business/Enterprise plan). |
| `media` | `validate_media` | Checking a media URL is reachable before posting (media is referenced by URL; there is no upload/library/resize tool). |
| `generate` | `generate_post`, `recommend_hashtags` | Drafting AI post copy (never publishes) or suggesting hashtags for a keyword (TikTok-sourced; uses the targeted profile's linked TikTok account). |
| `webhooks` | `register_webhook`, `unregister_webhook`, `list_webhooks` | Subscribing to push notifications (e.g. when a scheduled post publishes) instead of polling. |
| `errors` | `explain_error` | Decoding an Ayrshare `Error <code>` into a plain-English cause + fix. |
| `draft-in-brand-voice` | (workflow: `get_platform_history`/`get_post_history` → `get_post_analytics` → `generate_post` → `validate_post`) | Writing on-brand content by matching a profile's established voice from its post history; drafts only. |
| `plan-and-schedule-campaign` | (workflow: `validate_post` → `create_post` per post, with `scheduleDate`) | Planning and scheduling a multi-post, multi-platform campaign or content calendar, validating each post first. |

The last two are multi-step **workflow** skills: they orchestrate the tools above rather than adding new ones. Tool names follow the plugin's `mcp__ayrshare__<action>` convention (e.g. `mcp__ayrshare__create_post`).

---

## Optional Configuration

The API key is supplied through the `AYRSHARE_API_KEY` environment variable, which the `ayrshare` server's `.mcp.json` interpolates into its `Authorization` header (`Bearer ${AYRSHARE_API_KEY}`). `/ayrshare:setup` sets that variable for you in a `settings.json` `env` block. Profile scoping has two equivalent inputs: a `Profile-Key` connection header (the default for every call) **or** an optional `profileKey` tool argument on a profile-scoped tool call (the argument wins when both are set; a few utility/AI tools such as `generate_post` and `recommend_hashtags` are excluded, see `getting-started`). The per-call argument lets an agent act as a client it learns at runtime without editing `.mcp.json` or restarting.

The bundled `.mcp.json` already declares the optional `Profile-Key` and X BYOK headers with empty defaults (`${VAR:-}`), so you enable each by setting the matching environment variable (same `settings.json` `env` block as `AYRSHARE_API_KEY`, on any OS) and restarting. Leave a variable unset and its header goes out empty, which the server treats as not provided. No `.mcp.json` editing, and nothing to redo after `claude plugin update`.

### Act as a specific client profile (`AYRSHARE_PROFILE_KEY` or `profileKey` argument)

Set `AYRSHARE_PROFILE_KEY` (in your `settings.json` `env`) and restart to default the whole connection to one client; the bundled `Profile-Key: ${AYRSHARE_PROFILE_KEY:-}` header carries it. With it unset, calls act on the account's primary profile. To act as a client for a single call instead, pass `profileKey` as a tool argument on a profile-scoped call (it takes precedence over the header, no restart needed). The `generate_jwt_social_linking_url` tool uses the same target-profile value (required for that tool, via either input). You do not pass a private key or domain (the server derives them from your authenticated account), but the account must still have a **provisioned social-linking domain (Business/Enterprise)**; without one the call returns a "No social-linking domain is provisioned for this account" error.

### Bring-your-own X/Twitter app (BYOK)

Posting to X/Twitter requires your own X Developer App (the [X BYO-key mandate](https://www.ayrshare.com/docs/apis/overview#x/twitter-byo-credentials), effective March 31, 2026). After linking X with your app's credentials, set **both** environment variables and restart (values are never logged):

- `X_TWITTER_OAUTH1_API_KEY` — your X API Key (Consumer Key); sent as the `X-Twitter-OAuth1-Api-Key` header.
- `X_TWITTER_OAUTH1_API_SECRET` — your X API Secret (Consumer Secret); sent as the `X-Twitter-OAuth1-Api-Secret` header.

These are the only X BYO headers Ayrshare uses: one key pair per Ayrshare account, sent on every X-targeting request (the same pair for all sub-profiles). Ayrshare does **not** use OAuth 2.0 client credentials here. Set both or neither: with neither set, an X/Twitter request returns error `419` (`x_credentials_required`); with only one set, it returns error `400`.

## Supported Platforms
