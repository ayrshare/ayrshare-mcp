# Ayrshare for Claude Code

The unified social media API for AI agents. Publish, schedule, and analyze across 13+ networks directly from Claude Code, with post history for brand voice and validation against each platform's rules before every post. Powered by the [Ayrshare](https://www.ayrshare.com) API.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare
```

Then run `/ayrshare:setup` to add your API key and **restart Claude Code**. Scopes and other install paths are under [Installation](#installation) below.

After restarting, use the plugin by **asking in plain English** (e.g. "show my recent Instagram posts", "post this to LinkedIn tomorrow at 9am"); the tools fire on intent, and the trigger-skills route them. `/ayrshare:setup` is the only slash command, so there is no `/ayrshare:post` or `/ayrshare:get_post_history` to type.

## Overview

The plugin lets an agent run the full social workflow without leaving Claude Code. Before publishing, the agent validates each post against the target network's rules and asks you to confirm, so avoidable rejections are caught before anything goes live. A single request publishes to Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, Reddit, Telegram, Threads, Bluesky, and others. Post history is available for matching a brand's voice, and analytics can be read back to inform the next post. Platform integrations are maintained by Ayrshare, so upstream API changes are handled outside your code. The API currently handles 25M+ calls per day.

## The loop

- **Learn**. Retrieve a profile's post history for brand-voice context and review how past posts performed.
- **Act**. Publish and schedule across 13+ networks in a single call.
- **Observe**. Read live analytics to inform the next post.
- **Stay safe**. Validate each post against platform rules, then confirm before publishing.

---
## Why use the API instead of a custom integration?

An LLM can generate an OAuth flow, but it does not cover Meta Tech Provider approval, X's pay-per-use API changes, or ongoing maintenance when a network changes its rules. The plugin handles:

- **Pre-publish validation**. `validate_post` dry-runs content against each network's rules (length, format, media requirements) before you publish, and `validate_media` checks that a media URL is reachable before you attach it in `mediaUrls`. X BYOK is supported for the 2026 mandate, and platform integrations are maintained so an upstream API change does not break your integration.
- **One call, 13+ networks**. A single request publishes to all connected platforms, each validated against its own rules.
- **Multi-tenant**. Post on behalf of many user profiles rather than a single brand.
- **History API**. Retrieve a profile's past posts for brand-voice context, and use historical performance data to inform future posts.

### Safety

By default the plugin validates a post and requests confirmation before publishing. The agent prepares the draft; the user approves it.

## Installation

### Plugin installation scopes

The plugin scope controls where commands, agents, and skills are available. First register this repo as a marketplace (one time):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin
```

Then install the `ayrshare` plugin (`plugin@marketplace`) at the scope you want:

| Scope | Command | Where it's available |
|---|---|---|
| Global (default) | `claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare` | Every project on this machine |
| This project only | `claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare --scope local` | Current project, not committed to git |
| This project (shared) | `claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare --scope project` | Current project, committed to git with the team |

After installing, configure your API key:

```text
/ayrshare:setup
```

`/ayrshare:setup` will ask for your key and where to store it — choose the option that matches how you installed the plugin.

---

### Detailed walkthroughs

#### Global — available in all your projects

```bash
# 1. Register the marketplace (one time)
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin

# 2. Install the plugin globally (user is the default scope)
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare

# 3. Configure your API key (sets AYRSHARE_API_KEY in ~/.claude/settings.json)
# Run inside Claude Code:
/ayrshare:setup   # accept the default "Global" when asked
```

Commands, agents, and skills are available in every project. The key is stored as `AYRSHARE_API_KEY` in `~/.claude/settings.json`, which is exactly what the plugin's MCP server reads. No project files are modified.

---

#### This project only — local, not committed

```bash
# 1. Register the marketplace (one time)
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin

# 2. Install scoped to the current project (not committed to git)
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare --scope local

# 3. Configure your API key (sets AYRSHARE_API_KEY in ./.claude/settings.local.json)
# Run inside Claude Code:
/ayrshare:setup   # choose "This project" when asked
```

Commands, agents, and skills only appear in this project. The key is written as `AYRSHARE_API_KEY` to `./.claude/settings.local.json` so it stays out of git. Ensure that path is in your `.gitignore` (a default `*.local` pattern does **not** match `settings.local.json`) and confirm `git status` does not list it. Use the committed `./.claude/settings.json` only if you deliberately want to share one key with your team via the repo (not recommended for a secret).

---

#### This project — committed with the team

```bash
# 1. Register the marketplace (one time)
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin

# 2. Install scoped to the project (committed to git)
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare --scope project

# 3. Configure your API key (sets your key in ./.claude/settings.local.json; gitignore that path)
# Run inside Claude Code:
/ayrshare:setup   # choose "This project" when asked
```

The plugin is committed to the repo so the whole team gets it automatically. Each developer runs `/ayrshare:setup` individually to configure their own API key. Each developer's key should go in `./.claude/settings.local.json`, and that path should be added to `.gitignore` (a default `*.local` pattern does **not** match `settings.local.json`) so keys are never committed.

---

### MCP only (no plugin)

If you only want the raw MCP tools without commands, agents, or skills:

```bash
claude mcp add ayrshare --transport http \
  https://api.ayrshare.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Add `--scope local` to limit it to the current project. The key is stored permanently in Claude Code's config — run once and you are done.

---

### Environment variable (CI / advanced)

For CI environments or users who manage env vars via shell profile:

```bash
export AYRSHARE_API_KEY=your_key_here
claude plugin marketplace add ayrshare/ayrshare-social-media-api-claude-plugin
claude plugin install ayrshare@ayrshare
```

The plugin's `.mcp.json` uses `${AYRSHARE_API_KEY}` — Claude Code substitutes it at startup. No setup command needed.

---

## Credentials by surface

Install the plugin once; then there is **one credential step per surface**. The plugin always reads the same four variables (`AYRSHARE_API_KEY` is required; `AYRSHARE_PROFILE_KEY`, `X_TWITTER_OAUTH1_API_KEY`, and `X_TWITTER_OAUTH1_API_SECRET` are optional), but *where* you put them depends on the surface, because credential resolution differs:

| Surface | How credentials are supplied | Profile-Key | X BYOK |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (CLI / IDE) | `settings.json` `env` block via `/ayrshare:setup` (or set the vars yourself); a shell `export` before launch also works | `AYRSHARE_PROFILE_KEY` env, or per-call `profileKey` argument | `X_TWITTER_OAUTH1_API_KEY` + `X_TWITTER_OAUTH1_API_SECRET` env |
| **Cowork / claude.ai desktop app** | No first-class path yet. A verified but costly workaround uses an admin-deployed `managed-mcp.json` with **literal** header values (see "Setting your key in Cowork"); the claude.ai connector UI cannot attach a key, and `settings.json` `env` is **not** read here | `Profile-Key` header (literal) in that file | the two `X-Twitter-OAuth1-*` headers (literal) in that file |
| **CI / headless** | OS environment variables set before launch | `AYRSHARE_PROFILE_KEY` env | the two env vars |

A key set for Claude Code does **not** carry over to Cowork, and vice versa: `${VAR}` interpolation is a Claude Code feature, and Cowork needs literal values supplied through an admin-deployed `managed-mcp.json`. So the "Claude Code, all projects" option in `/ayrshare:setup` means all Claude Code projects, not all Claude surfaces.

## Setting your key in Cowork

> **There is no first-class way to authenticate this plugin in Cowork / the claude.ai desktop app yet.** Cowork does not read `~/.claude/settings.json` `env` and does not expand `${VAR}`, so the `/ayrshare:setup` flow never reaches it. The OAuth 2.1 work on the [Roadmap](#roadmap) is the real fix. Until then, the one mechanism we have verified end to end is an admin-deployed `managed-mcp.json`. It works, but it seizes exclusive, machine-wide control of MCP, so weigh the costs below before using it.

> ⚠️ **Do not add Ayrshare as a claude.ai / org connector.** The connector UI loads all of the plugin's tools, but it has no field for an `Authorization` header, so every call returns `403` (`code 102`) with no way for an end user to supply a key. This route stays unusable until OAuth ships. Use the `managed-mcp.json` workaround below, or use Claude Code.

### The verified workaround: `managed-mcp.json`

An org admin deploys a `managed-mcp.json` file holding the plugin's server with **literal** header values (Cowork cannot expand `${VAR}`). It is a standard `mcpServers` block, the same shape as a project `.mcp.json`. See the [managed MCP docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/managed-mcp.md).

1. As an admin, create the managed MCP file:
   - **macOS:** `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-mcp.json`
   - **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-mcp.json`
   - **Linux / WSL:** `/etc/claude-code/managed-mcp.json`
2. Add an `mcpServers` entry keyed **exactly** `ayrshare`. Every skill and agent in this plugin calls tools named `mcp__ayrshare__*`, so any other key leaves all of them stale. Use literal values, and **omit** any optional header you are not using rather than leaving a placeholder or empty string:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "ayrshare": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://api.ayrshare.com/mcp",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_AYRSHARE_API_KEY",
           "Profile-Key": "YOUR_PROFILE_KEY",
           "X-Twitter-OAuth1-Api-Key": "YOUR_X_CONSUMER_KEY",
           "X-Twitter-OAuth1-Api-Secret": "YOUR_X_CONSUMER_SECRET"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   Only `Authorization` is required. X BYOK uses the same two headers here as on every other surface.
3. **Restart the app** and start a **new session**; managed MCP servers load at startup.

**Verify it loaded:** run `claude mcp list`. It should show **only** the `ayrshare` managed server, and `claude mcp add ...` should now fail with an enterprise-policy error. Then, in a new Cowork session, run a read such as "list my profiles".

### The costs (read before deploying)

`managed-mcp.json` does not add a server alongside the others. It **replaces** the entire MCP set machine-wide. While it is in place:

- **It suppresses the plugin's own bundled MCP server** (the one `/ayrshare:setup` configures) and **every user-added MCP server**, on the whole machine, **including in Claude Code**, not just Cowork. Only servers listed in `managed-mcp.json` load anywhere.
- **It suppresses claude.ai connectors** too, unless an admin also sets `"allowAllClaudeAiMcps": true` in `managed-settings.json` (the *settings* file, not the MCP file; needs Claude Code v2.1.149 or newer). That flag re-enables claude.ai connectors **only**; it does not bring back the plugin's own server or any user-added server.
- **It needs admin rights** to a protected system path, and it stores the API key as a **world-readable literal** in that file (no `${VAR}` indirection). Treat it like any deployed secret.

If you only need Ayrshare in Claude Code, skip all of this and use `/ayrshare:setup`. The `managed-mcp.json` route is for orgs that specifically need the plugin inside Cowork today and accept taking over MCP machine-wide until OAuth lands.

Symptom table:

| What you see | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Tools listed, but every call returns `403 / code 102` | `Authorization` missing or wrong; credentials are not reaching the server |
| X/Twitter calls return `419` | No X BYOK headers; add both `X-Twitter-OAuth1-*` |
| X/Twitter calls return `400` | Only one of the two X BYOK headers is set |
| Calls act on the wrong or primary profile | `Profile-Key` not set, or set to the wrong value |

---

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/ayrshare:setup` | Configure or rotate your API key |

The former `/ayrshare:post`, `/ayrshare:analytics`, and `/ayrshare:profiles` commands were consolidated into the **social-manager** and **profile-manager** agents and the trigger-based skills below.

---

## Skills

Trigger-based skills activate automatically on intent (even when you don't name Ayrshare) and teach Claude how to drive the MCP tools correctly: the auth model (API key, plus optional profile selection by `Profile-Key` header or per-call `profileKey` argument), retry safety, and platform quirks. They cover all 27 of the server's tools. **Start with `getting-started`**; every group skill cross-links to it.

| Skill | Tools | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `getting-started` | (cross-cutting) | Installing/configuring the plugin, any 401/403, "which credential do I use", onboarding a client, or missing `AYRSHARE_API_KEY`. Home of the auth model (API key, plus `Profile-Key` header or per-call `profileKey` argument), onboarding sequence, retry/`explain_error` rules, and the free-trial link. |
| `post` | `create_post`, `validate_post`, `get_post`, `update_post`, `retry_post` | Validating, posting, scheduling, editing, fetching, or retrying social content. |
| `history` | `get_post_history`, `get_platform_history` | Listing posts sent via Ayrshare, or native posts (incl. ones not made via Ayrshare) and finding native Social Post IDs. |
| `analytics` | `get_post_analytics`, `get_post_analytics_by_social_id`, `get_social_network_analytics` | Per-post analytics (by Ayrshare or native Social Post ID) or account/network analytics (followers, reach, impressions). |
| `comments` | `get_comments`, `add_comment`, `reply_comment` | Reading, adding, or replying to comments on a post. |
| `messages` | `get_messages`, `send_message`, `get_auto_response`, `set_auto_response` | Reading/sending direct messages (Facebook, Instagram, X) or configuring the DM auto-responder. |
| `profiles` | `list_profiles`, `create_profile`, `generate_jwt_social_linking_url` | Creating or listing client profiles (account-level), or minting a client's social-account linking URL for the target profile (set by the `profileKey` argument or `Profile-Key` header; Business/Enterprise plan). |
| `media` | `validate_media` | Checking a media URL is reachable before posting (media is referenced by URL; there is no upload/library/resize tool). |
| `generate` | `generate_post`, `recommend_hashtags` | Drafting AI post copy (never publishes) or suggesting hashtags for a keyword (TikTok-sourced; uses the targeted profile's linked TikTok account). |
| `webhooks` | `register_webhook`, `unregister_webhook`, `list_webhooks` | Subscribing to push notifications (e.g. when a scheduled post publishes) instead of polling. |
| `errors` | `explain_error` | Decoding an Ayrshare error code into a plain-English cause + fix. |
| `draft-in-brand-voice` | (workflow: `get_platform_history`/`get_post_history` → `get_post_analytics` → `generate_post` → `validate_post`) | Writing on-brand content by matching a profile's established voice from its post history; drafts only. |
| `plan-and-schedule-campaign` | (workflow: `validate_post` → `create_post` per post, with `scheduleDate`) | Planning and scheduling a multi-post, multi-platform campaign or content calendar, validating each post first. |

The last two are multi-step **workflow** skills: they orchestrate the tools above rather than adding new ones. Tool names follow the plugin's `mcp__ayrshare__<action>` convention (e.g. `mcp__ayrshare__create_post`).

---

## Optional Configuration

The API key is supplied through the `AYRSHARE_API_KEY` environment variable, which the `ayrshare` server's `.mcp.json` interpolates into its `Authorization` header (`Bearer ${AYRSHARE_API_KEY}`). `/ayrshare:setup` sets that variable for you in a `settings.json` `env` block. Profile scoping has two equivalent inputs: a `Profile-Key` connection header (the default for every call) **or** an optional `profileKey` tool argument on a profile-scoped tool call (the argument wins when both are set; a few utility/AI tools such as `generate_post` and `recommend_hashtags` are excluded, see `getting-started`). The per-call argument lets an agent act as a client it learns at runtime without editing `.mcp.json` or restarting.

The bundled `.mcp.json` already declares the optional `Profile-Key` and X BYOK headers with empty defaults (`${VAR:-}`), so you enable each by setting the matching environment variable (same `settings.json` `env` block as `AYRSHARE_API_KEY`, on any OS) and restarting. Leave a variable unset and its header goes out empty, which the server treats as not provided. No `.mcp.json` editing, and nothing to redo after `claude plugin update`.

### Act as a specific client profile (`AYRSHARE_PROFILE_KEY` or `profileKey` argument)

Set `AYRSHARE_PROFILE_KEY` (in your `settings.json` `env`) and restart to default the whole connection to one client; the bundled `Profile-Key: ${AYRSHARE_PROFILE_KEY:-}` header carries it. With it unset, calls act on the account's primary profile. To act as a client for a single call instead, pass `profileKey` as a tool argument on a profile-scoped call (it takes precedence over the header, no restart needed). The `generate_jwt_social_linking_url` tool uses the same target-profile value (required for that tool, via either input). You do not pass a private key or domain (the server derives them from your authenticated account), but the account must still have a **provisioned social-linking domain (Business/Enterprise)**; without one the call returns a "No social-linking domain is provisioned for this account" error.

### Bring-your-own X/Twitter app (BYOK)

Posting to X/Twitter requires your own X Developer App (the [X BYO-key mandate](https://www.ayrshare.com/docs/apis/overview#x/twitter-byo-credentials), effective March 31, 2026). After linking X with your app's credentials, set **both** environment variables and restart (values are never logged):

- `X_TWITTER_OAUTH1_API_KEY`: your X API Key (Consumer Key); sent as the `X-Twitter-OAuth1-Api-Key` header.
- `X_TWITTER_OAUTH1_API_SECRET`: your X API Secret (Consumer Secret); sent as the `X-Twitter-OAuth1-Api-Secret` header.

These are the only X BYO headers Ayrshare uses: one key pair per Ayrshare account, sent on every X-targeting request (the same pair for all sub-profiles). Ayrshare does **not** use OAuth 2.0 client credentials here. Set both or neither: with neither set, an X/Twitter request returns error `419` (`x_credentials_required`); with only one set, it returns error `400`.

---

## Supported Platforms

Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, Reddit, Telegram, Threads, Bluesky, Snapchat, and Google Business Profile — depending on your Ayrshare plan and connected profiles.

---

## Roadmap

- **Zero-config per-user auth (MCP OAuth 2.1): our top auth priority.** This is the only path that makes Cowork and the claude.ai desktop app first-class surfaces, so it is the next major auth investment for this plugin. We plan to add MCP-spec OAuth 2.1 (PKCE, dynamic client registration, authorization-server and protected-resource metadata) to `api.ayrshare.com/mcp`. Once shipped, an org-installed plugin authenticates per user on the first tool call ("Connect to Ayrshare", a dashboard login, a per-user token) on **every** surface, with no manual key step and no files. Claude Code already supports this flow via `/mcp` authenticate, so setup collapses to "install, then click Connect" everywhere. Until it lands, the per-surface credential steps above are the supported path on Claude Code, and the `managed-mcp.json` workaround is the only verified way to reach Cowork.
